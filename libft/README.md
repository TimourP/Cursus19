# Libft
Libft consists in rewriting the main functions of standard C library in order to use them in our future projects and thus allow us to work almost from scratch. 

The goal of this project is to assimilate correctly the concepts of variables, functions, pointers and linked list in C. Moreover, this project requires to be able to manage properly the malloc and free functions in order to access the power of the heap memory and to avoid leaks.
